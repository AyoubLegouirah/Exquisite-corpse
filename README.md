# C'est l'histoire d'un dragon

Il était une fois un dragon solitaire nommé Drako. Il vivait dans une grotte au sommet d'une montagne, gardant un trésor scintillant. Les villageois le craignaient, mais Drako était en réalité un dragon gentil et solitaire.
He bought some flowers and gave them to his wifes.
Then they both decided to travel to London because they wanted to see Big Ben.
They enjoyed riding through the city in the red buses.
He was brave and strong. He wasnt gonna let his friends die over a banana problem. No one could stop the main protagonist of the story, superman and spiderman couldnt do anything to him.
Beneath a canopy of stars, an inscrutable object beckoned within the long-forgotten ruins. Driven by curiosity, a lone wanderer ventured forth, dismissing the echoes of the past. Upon touching the relic, an age-old force was unshackled, irrevocably altering their destiny.

Once upon a time, there was a peaceful kingdom nestled within the embrace of majestic mountains. Its inhabitants lived in harmony with the mystical creatures that populated these lands. Among them, the dragons stood out for their grandeur and power.
